# Locates Client

Technologies: React + Typescript
TODOs:

1. put session in context
2. Add validation on the second time of clicking the buttons.
3. Sort table by machine name
4. Improve ui
5. Share shortage by multiple machines

Dividing resources considerations:

1. Equal distribution: Each machine gets an equal locates from each symbol. This approach is easy to implement, but it may not be the most efficient use of locates if some machines have different requirements.

2. Proportional distribution: Resources are allocated based on the relative needs of each machine. This approach takes into account the different requirements of each machine and is more efficient than equal distribution, but it may not be considered fair by all parties if the needs are subjective or difficult to quantify.

3. Random split: each machine get locates by random distribution.
